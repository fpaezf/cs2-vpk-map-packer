# Counter-Strike 2 VPK map packer
MapPacker.exe is a console application written in C# to pack files and folders to a VPK file to use it in Source 2 engine games like Counter-Strike 2.

# How to use
To pack files you have to start MapPacker.exe with 2 command line arguments each one enclosed in quotes.
- **#1:** A source folder containing the files you want to pack
- **#2:** A target vpk file to store the packet files and folders

**EXAMPLE:**
MapPacker.exe "C:\Users\Francesc\Downloads\Map Files" "C:\Users\Francesc\Desktop\test.vpk"

If you not enclose the parameters in quotes, te application will fail.
